        title: 'Mobile App Development',
        content: `
            <h3>Native & Cross-Platform Solutions</h3>
            <p>Mobile app development refers to the process of creating software applications that run on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Mobile app development involves several stages, including concept, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Mobile Development Services:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>iOS App Development:</strong> Native apps for iPhone and iPad using Swift and Objective-C, optimized for performance and user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Android App Development:</strong> Native Android applications using Kotlin and Java, supporting all Android devices and versions.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Platform Development:</strong> Build once, deploy everywhere with React Native, Flutter, or Xamarin - saving time and costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive Web Apps:</strong> Hybrid solutions that combine the best of web and mobile apps.</li>
                <li><strong>App Maintenance & Updates:</strong> Continuous support, bug fixes, feature updates, and OS compatibility updates.</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>Native vs Cross-Platform Development:</h3>
            <p><strong>Native App Development:</strong> Involves building apps specifically for a particular operating system, such as iOS or Android. This approach allows for more optimization and better performance, as the app is tailored to the specific platform. Native apps provide the best user experience and full access to device features.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Cross-Platform Development:</strong> Involves building apps that can run on multiple platforms using a single codebase. This approach can save time and resources, but may sacrifice some performance and user experience compared to native apps. However, modern frameworks like Flutter and React Native have significantly closed this gap.</p>
            
            <h3>Technologies We Use:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Swift, Objective-C, SwiftUI, UIKit</li>
                <li><strong>Android:</strong> Kotlin, Java, Jetpack Compose</li>

                <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Firebase, AWS Amplify, Node.js, Custom APIs</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Our App Development Process:</h3>
            <p>We follow an agile development methodology that includes discovery, design, development, testing, deployment, and ongoing maintenance. Our team ensures your app is secure, scalable, and provides an exceptional user experience that keeps users engaged.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Ready to Build Your App?</strong> Whether you need a consumer-facing app, enterprise solution, or startup MVP, we have the expertise to bring your vision to life.</p>
